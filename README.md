# Optimization Modeling with Python-Pyomo

This repository explores **MINLP** (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming) and **NLP** (Nonlinear Programming) problems using Pyomo. 

**Contents:** 

├ Pyomo: In the reference course, CVXPY was used for modeling. Here, I re-implemented and solved five problems from scratch using Pyomo, obtaining the same results.
- Portfolio optimization
- Worst-case risk analysis
- Optimal advertising
- Huber regression
- Quantile regression
- Model fitting
